<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the home of our Irish cousins we are
not very familiar, but with our Irish cousins
themselves we have a better acquaintance, for
many of them have come over to settle in
America, and they were among the bravest of
the American troops in the World War. Of
the part in the war taken by their people in Ireland
we do not know so intimately, but we do
know that they sent many men to France to
help England defeat the Germans. They
took our boys to their homes, and fed and
clothed them; they nursed them back to health
and strength, and by so doing the people of
Ireland won their way into the hearts of the
people of America.</p>

<p>Since the end of the war the bond between
the two countries has grown even closer, for,
under the leadership of America, the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of Europe began to listen to Ireland's plea for
home rule. This plea was backed up by active
Revolution, as was our own struggle for independence.
Finally the Imperial British Government,
with the interests of the Irish people
at heart, granted them Home Rule, to control
their own destinies within the British Empire.
Unfortunately, however, even this did not
prove a complete solution of Ireland's difficulties,
for some of the Irish people wished to
remain attached to England, and enjoy the advantages
of her wise and just rule. These
were the people of Northern Ireland, called
Ulster. So it has been agreed that they shall
remain under English rule, leaving Home Rule
for Southern Ireland.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_2" id="Page_v_2">[v]</a></span></p>




<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have often heard people speak of the
Emerald Isle. When you have asked where
it is and why it is so called, you have been
told it is only another name for that small
island to the northwest of the continent of
Europe called Ireland.</p>

<p>The rains there fall so often, and the sun
shines so warmly afterward, that Mother Nature
is able to dress herself in the brightest
and loveliest of colours. The people there
are cheerful and good-natured. They are
always ready to smile through their tears and
see the funny side of every hardship.</p>

<p>And, alas! many things have happened to
cause their tears to flow. They have suffered
from poverty and hunger. Thousands of
them have been forced to leave parents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_2" id="Page_vi_2">[vi]</a></span>
friends, and seek a living within the kindly
shores of America.</p>

<p>America is great, America is kind, they may
think, but oh! for one look at the beautiful
lakes of Killarney; oh! for a walk over the
green fields and hills of the Emerald Isle.
And oh! for the chance to gather a cluster
of shamrock, the emblem of dear old Erin.</p>

<p>The little Irish cousin, who has never left
her native land, may be poor, and sometimes
ragged, but her heart is warm and tender, and
she loves her country and her people with
a love that will never change, no matter
where she may travel or what fortune may
befall her.</p>

<h2>Our Little Irish Cousin</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NORAH</div>


<div class='poem'>
"Londonderry, Cork, and Kerry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Spell <i>that</i> to me without a K."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Can</span> you do it now?" said Norah,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Can I do it? Yes, easy enough, for I've
heard the riddle before. T-h-a-t. There,
Norah, you didn't catch me this time."</p>

<p>Molly laughed, too, as she spoke, and the
little girls went on dressing their rag dolls.</p>

<p>They were great friends, these two children
of Ireland, and, although they were ragged
and dirty most of the time, and neither of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
them owned hats or shoes, they were happy
as the day is long. And, when I say this, I
mean one of the longest days of Ireland,
which are very long indeed.</p>

<p>Norah had beautiful blue eyes and dark
auburn hair. Her teeth were like pearls and
her cheeks were rosy as the brightest sunset.</p>

<p>"She is a true daughter of Erin," thought
her mother, as she looked at the child.
"May God will that she grow up to be as
good as she is beautiful," she said to herself,
making the sign of the cross on her breast.</p>

<p>As for Molly, Norah's little playmate, her
hair was black as night. Many other lads
and lasses of Ireland have hair like that. It
is because, long years ago, before even the
Christ-child dwelt among men, Spaniards came
to the west coast of Ireland and settled among
the people there.</p>

<p>They gave their black hair and dark eyes to
the people already in the country, most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
whom were fair in face, hair, and eyes. So it
happens that sometimes they now have dark
hair and blue eyes, and sometimes light hair
and dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Norah! Norah, darlint! Come and feed
the pigs," called her mother. "They are that
hungry they would eat the thatch off the
house if they could reach it."</p>

<p>Norah jumped up, and running home as
fast as her young feet could carry her, took
the dish of mush from her mother's hands.
She was instantly surrounded by a thin old
mother pig and her ten little ones.</p>

<p>They were cunning little things when they
were born, and Norah loved to hold them in
her arms and pet them. But they were big
enough now to root about in the mud, and
the little girl held them no longer.</p>

<p>"Oof! oof!" grunted the mother pig.
"Good! good!" was what she meant, of
course, as she swallowed her supper as quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as possible, and the ten babies followed her
example.</p>

<p>Then Norah had to feed the ducks and
chickens, and her precious goat.</p>

<p>"I love it. Oh, I love it, next to father
and mother and the children," thought the
little girl.</p>

<p>"How much it knows, and how gentle it
is! And what should we do without the
sweet, rich milk it gives us!" she said, turning
to Molly, who was helping her in her
work.</p>

<p>"It is a dear little creature" (Molly pronounced
it crayther), "but I love our pet
cow better. I suppose the reason is because
it is ours. But, good night till ye, Norah. I
must be after getting home."</p>

<p>Molly went running down the lane, while
Norah entered the house.</p>

<p>House! It would hardly be fair to give
it such a grand name. It was a small stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hut, not much taller than Norah's father, with
a roof covered with mud and straw mixed
together. Such a roof is said to be thatched.</p>

<p>There was only one window in the hut, and
that was a small one. The door was divided
across the middle, and the upper part of it
stood wide open. Yet, as Norah stepped
inside, the air was thick and heavy with
smoke.</p>

<p>Over in one corner was a fireplace, and in it
cakes of dried peat were slowly burning. It
was the only kind of fuel Norah's mother had
to burn, so it was no wonder the air of the
room was smoky.</p>

<p>Do you know what peat is? In Norah's
country there are many square miles of marshy
land covered with moss and grasses. If it
could speak to us, this land would tell a
wonderful story.</p>

<p>"Ages and ages ago," it would say, "great
forests of oak stood here. The trees grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
large and strong. But the rain fell often and
the air was very damp. This is the reason
mosses and other plants gathered on the
trunks and branches of the trees. They
sent their roots into the moist bark and fed
on the sap that should have nourished the trees.</p>

<p>"The great trees became weaker and
weaker as the years passed away, until at
last they sickened and died, and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Fir-trees began to grow in the places of
the oaks. But they were treated in the same
manner. Their life-giving sap was taken by a
new growth of mosses. The fir-trees died,
and added to the great masses of decaying
wood which now covered the damp ground.</p>

<p>"Then plants grew up. But they met
with the same fate as the trees.</p>

<p>"Thousands and thousands of years passed
by. The beautiful forests that once covered
the land were slowly changed into peat."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The peat-bogs are now so thick and heavy
that the poor of Ireland can dig twenty-five
feet into them and cut out squares of the solid
peat.</p>

<p>After drying them in the air and sunshine,
the people burn them in place of coal. This
queer fuel does not make as bright and clear a
fire as coal, but it is cheap, and keeps the poor
from suffering.</p>

<p>"Be patient and wait only a few more
thousands of years," the bogs would say to
us if they could, "and you may have coal
instead of peat. Father Time will make the
change without any work on your part."</p>

<p>But the people of Ireland cannot wait.
Most of them are very, very poor. They
live from day to day, glad if they have a roof
to cover their heads and food enough to keep
them from starving.</p>

<p>Norah's father hires the land for his little
farm from a rich lord who lives most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
year in England. The Irishman built the
little hut on this land for himself and wife,
and his family of growing children.</p>

<p>"What use would it be to spend much
time on it?" he would say. "The better
I make the place, the more rent I shall have
to pay."</p>

<p>Every year he planted his patch of potatoes
and cabbages for himself, besides oats and
turnips and other things for his fowls and pigs
and goat. He mended the thatched roof
when it leaked too badly for comfort, and
they all tried to be happy. They succeeded
pretty well.</p>

<p>When each new year came around, the
home looked about as usual. It was no
better, and no worse, unless, perhaps, it was
a wee bit more shabby.</p>

<p>But the children grew fast. They were
merry and rosy, and thought very little about
the shabby stone hut they called "home."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sivin of us there are," Norah would tell
you, "and baby Pat is the dearest and best of
us all."</p>

<p>As she came in to supper that night, her
mother lifted the kettle that hung by a hook
over the smoky fire and made a pot of tea.
Then she placed a dish of steaming potatoes
and a plate of dark, heavy bread on the table.</p>

<p>"A good supper, indade," thought the hungry
children, and in a few minutes not a sign
of anything to eat could be seen.</p>

<p>"Here chick! chick!" called Norah, dropping
crumbs to her pet chicken. It had kept
close beside her during the meal, and once
had grown so impatient that it flew up into
the little girl's lap.</p>

<p>An old hen had already gone to roost on
the rung of a stool in a dark corner of the
room, while the much-loved goat stood
munching grass at Norah's elbow.</p>

<p>The child's mother did not seem troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the least by these things. She was busy as
busy could be, giving hot potatoes and slices
of bread to Mike and Joe, Norah and Katie,
while she trotted baby Patsy on her knee.</p>

<p>But when the whole flock of geese came
running and flying into the hut for their share
of the family supper, it was a little too much.</p>

<p>"Away with you, noisy creatures!" cried
the busy mother. "Away with you! Mike,
take the broom and drive them out. Joe,
lend a hand and help your brother."</p>

<p>When the room had been cleared of the
greedy geese, every one went on eating, until
not even a crumb was left on the table.</p>

<p>The girls cleared away the dishes; the boys
brought a load of peat into the house, and
placed it before the fire to dry for burning; the
mother rocked Patsy to Dreamland, and the
father smoked his pipe.</p>

<p>Then, when the work was all done, he told
the children there was good news.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, what is it?" they all cried
together.</p>

<p>"A letter from our own Maggie, in
Ameriky. Sure, what else could the good
news be?" said their father. "Listen, and
you shall hear it.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"<span class="smcap">'Dear Father and my own sweet
Mother</span>:&mdash;First of all, how are yoursilves
and the pigs and all the children? I have a
good place, and my mistress is very kind to
me. My work is not hard, and I am fast
learning the ways of this great country. My
wages is now two dollars and a half the week.
In the money of good ould Ireland, that is
just ten shillin's. By bein' careful since I
last wrote ye, I have saved enough to send
you two pounds. My master got the money

tay, and a new red woollen petticoat. You,
father, will have some grand leather boots,
and aich of the children must buy something
for the remimbrance of the sister Maggie far
across the great say.</p>

<p>"'Good-bye, and may the blissings of
Hiven fall upon ye.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"'<span class="smcap">Maggie O'Neil.</span>'"
</div></div>

<p>As he came to the end of the letter, every
one was silent for a moment. The mother
wiped away some tears which had fallen upon
her cheek, and her husband cleared his throat.</p>

<p>Two pounds! It seemed like a fortune to
the little family. It was nearly enough to pay
the year's rent.</p>

<p>"But the pigs are doing well, and, if they
keep on, there will be no trouble when rent
time comes," said the father, as they sat talking
the matter over. "The price of the pigs
will be enough for the rint, I'm thinkin'. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
shall be as Maggie said. Let the childer go to
bed and dream of the fine things they will see
in the town when they go shopping."</p>

<p>Somehow or other the children were all
stowed away for the night in the small room
next the kitchen, and Norah was soon sound
asleep, and dreaming a most wonderful dream.</p>

<p>It seemed in her dream that the goat was
harnessed to the jaunting-car belonging to the
father of her friend Molly. He was a very,
very big goat in the dream, and he looked
really handsome, as he capered down the lane,
carrying the whole family to market.</p>

<p>Norah's pet chicken was going to see the
sights, for he was perched on the goat's head.
The old mother pig ran by his side, and the
baby pigs, with their curly tails high up in the
air, were trying their best to keep up. Everybody
was laughing and singing to the tune of
an Irish jig that Norah's father was playing
on the bagpipes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE THUNDER-STORM</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Whisht</span>, now! The fairy folk are passing
along. We must get out of their way,
and greet them politely," said Norah to her
little sister Kate, as she made a bow, and
whispered, "God speed ye."</p>

<p>The children were out berrying, and were
quite a distance from home. They had wandered
down the lane running through their
little village, and were now on the road to
Killarney.</p>

<p>"Why, Norah?"</p>

<p>"When you see a cloud of dust sweeping
along, you may know the fairies are travelling.
It might bring something bad to us if we
stood in their way. We want them to be our
friends, of course."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, Norah. I'll be careful next
time. But I'm tired. Tell me a story about
the fairies."</p>

<p>"I'm tired, too, Katie darlint. But I'll tell
ye this much. There once was a man who
did not care for the fairies as he should. Perhaps
he did not believe they used arrows and
shot them at the cattle of those people with
whom they were angry. Oh, Katie, it is the
living truth that the fairies can bewitch any one
whom they please.</p>

<p>"Well, the man of whom I was tellin' ye
bought a farm. It was close to a beautiful
valley where the fairies had their home. He
built himself a house; he ploughed the land;
and then he made a lime-kiln on the very
borders of the fairies' home.</p>

<p>"They were so angry that they punished
him in many ways. But not all at once,
Katie darlint. First, they killed his
horse; next, three of his cows; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
though that wasn't enough, nine of his pigs
died.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="Traverlors in jaunting-car talking to Norah and her sister" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE DRIVER STOPPED HIS CAR AND ASKED NORAH HOW FAR IT WAS TO THE LAKES OF KILLARNEY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"The farmer knew well enough what was
the matter. He took down his lime-kiln, and
was careful after that to keep clear of the
borders of fairy-land."</p>

<p>"Look, look, Norah! I hear a carriage.
It may be people travelling through the
country. Put on your sweetest smile and
maybe they will give us a penny."</p>

<p>The two children stood still on one side of
the road. As the carriage passed them, little
Kate held out her chubby hands, saying, "A
penny, kind lady, if ye plaze."</p>

<p>She was quick to notice that, besides the
driver, three gentlemen and a lady filled the
seats of the jaunting-car.</p>

<p>"Take this, little one, for your rosy cheeks
and smiling face."</p>

<p>The lady threw out a three-penny
piece, as the driver stopped his car and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
asked Norah how far it was to the lakes of
Killarney.</p>

<p>"Four miles, sir, if ye keep straight on this
road," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Do you mean four Irish miles?" asked
one of the gentlemen. "For, if you do, we
have an hour's good drive before us."</p>

<p>"Sure, and I always supposed a mile is a
mile," answered Norah, with a perplexed look
in her eyes.</p>

<p>The gentleman laughed, and said, "If you
go to America when you grow up, you will
find that two of our miles will almost make
one of yours."</p>

<p>The car passed on, and the children stood
watching the travellers out of sight.</p>

<p>"Isn't it grand to be travelling like that,
Katie?" said her sister. "A jaunting-car is
one of the finest things in the world."</p>

<p>But the people who were in the carriage did
not agree with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the lady, "I'm afraid of
falling out whenever the horse goes fast.
And as for this beautiful country, I can only
see what is on one side of the road at a time."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said her husband.
"I have always wanted to ride in a jaunting-car,
but it is more fun to talk about it than to
really do it."</p>

<p>"But what is a jaunting-car?" perhaps you
are wondering.</p>

<p>It is a carriage in which the seats are placed
back to back, facing sideways. It has no top,
but has big wheels and big springs underneath.</p>

<p>A small jaunting-car, like the one which had
passed the children, has two wheels, and seats
long enough to hold four people, two on each
side. The driver's place is built out in front,
reaching over the horse's back. Such a car is
very light, and one horse can carry it easily.</p>

<p>But what the lady said was true. There
was no way for the passengers to hold on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
firmly. Besides this, they could see the view
on only one side at a time.</p>

<p>A story has been told of a man who was
travelling in Ireland and wished to see the
country. He rode in a jaunting-car from
Queenstown to Cork. He sat on the side of
the car toward the hill and did not get a single
view of the river. When he went back again
he changed his seat to the opposite side of the
car. And still he saw nothing but the hill.
It is no wonder that, when people spoke to
him about the river between Cork and
Queenstown, he said, "There is no river.
There is nothing to be seen except a hill."</p>

<p>Do you see the joke? And do you understand
the reason why he saw only one side of
the country, though he travelled twice over
the same road?</p>

<p>Norah and her little sister had just turned
to go home, when they noticed the sky had
grown black with heavy clouds.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is going to rain, Katie. We must
hurry, for I fear it will thunder and lighten,"
said Norah.</p>

<p>The children began to run. Although they
did not mind the rain, they were both afraid
of thunder-storms.</p>

<p>"There! hear that, and that!" sobbed
Katie, beginning to cry. A streak of lightning
had darted across the sky, followed
almost instantly by a loud peal of thunder.</p>

<p>Down came the rain in torrents, just as the
children turned from the road and entered
the lane leading to their own little village.
As they did so, the sound of wheels could be
heard behind them.</p>

<p>They were in too great a hurry and too
much frightened to turn around. But as they
reached their own door, the very jaunting-car
they had met on the road to Killarney drove up.</p>

<p>The children's mother had been watching
from the doorway.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in, children, as fast as you can. I
was near beside mesilf, I was that worried
about ye."</p>

<p>Then the good woman, turning with a welcome
smile to the people in the carriage, asked
them to shelter themselves from the storm in
her poor little cot.</p>

<p>The two drenched children rushed to the
fireplace and stood there with the water dripping
from their skirts and making little
puddles on the floor of the cabin.</p>

<p>In the meantime, their mother was making
her visitors as comfortable as she could. Two
of the gentlemen took seats on the edge of a
big feather bed, for there were not chairs
enough to go around. The lady was given
the best chair, after Norah's mother had
dusted it with her apron, and placed it near
the fire.</p>

<p>The flock of geese had somehow managed
to follow the visitors into the house, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
big apron was next used to drive the poor wet
creatures out into the storm. It was plain to
see they did not enjoy it any more than the
people themselves.</p>

<p>"You must excuse us for taking you by
surprise in this way," said the lady, as soon as
it was quiet enough for the kind Irishwoman
to hear her, "but we saw the storm suddenly
coming up, and we knew we were too
far from Killarney to get there before it
should break upon us." She smiled as she
went on, "Indeed, it overtook us before we
could even reach your village."</p>

<p>As she finished speaking, there was a blinding
flash of lightning. It was almost instantly
followed by a peal of thunder which shook
the little cabin again and again.</p>

<p>Norah's mother made the sign of the cross
upon her breast, and her lips moved in prayer.
Every one was silent as flash after flash of
bright light came through the window, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
one peal of thunder followed close upon
another.</p>

<p>It was a good half-hour before the storm
began to die away.</p>

<p>"Yes, the rain comes often in these parts,
and thunder-storms are a common matter in
the summer time," said Mrs. O'Neil, when
they fell to talking again.</p>

<p>"That is one of the reasons why I don't
like jaunting-cars," said her lady visitor.
"They have no covering, and in a sudden
rain there is no way of keeping dry."</p>

<p>"Wheniver the lightning comes as it did a
few minutes ago," said Mrs. O'Neil, "it
makes me think of a story told by me father,
God rest his sowl.</p>

<p>"There was once a man working in his
garden. It began to thunder, and the man
was scared. He put his head through a hole
in the wall. 'God save whativer is out of
me.' That is what he prayed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had no sooner said those words than
the wall fell and his head was taken off entirely.</p>

<p>"You see, he didn't pray for the <i>whole</i> of
him.</p>

<p>"Now, my good father said that was just
right. The man was selfish to think only of
himsilf. He should have prayed large, for all
the folk around him, and not small, just for himsilf.
It was the judgment of Hiven upon him.</p>

<p>"But, dear me! I must tend to my
baking. I had clean forgot it in the storm."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil turned to the fireplace and
lifted a round, low pot out of the ashes.
When she had set it on the table, she took off
the cover. Then, turning the pot upside
down, a dark, heavy loaf of bread fell out
upon the table.</p>

<p>The visitors rose to go, thanking the good
woman for her kindness in giving them shelter
during the storm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. O'Neil would not hear of their
leaving so near supper-time, with Killarney a
good hour's drive away.</p>

<p>She told them she had a nice pat of butter
in the cupboard. The wild berries picked by
the children had been covered over, so they
were not softened by the rain while on the
way home. With a pot of good tea and the
newly-baked bread, she proudly thought her
visitors might satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p>After looking at her husband and the other
gentlemen, the lady sat down again, saying:</p>

<p>"You are very kind and generous, Mrs.
O'Neil, like the rest of your people. Wherever
I have travelled in Ireland I have met
just such kindness. I shall never forget my
visit here.</p>

<p>"And what a beautiful country it is! I
never saw such green grass anywhere else in
the world. No wonder it is called 'The
Emerald Isle.'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil smiled her happiest smile.
She loved to hear her country praised.</p>

<p>"Ah! Ireland was a great place once," she
cried. "But times have changed, and many
of the days have been sad ones since the rule
of our own kings. Did ye ever hear tell of
the famine?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said one of the gentlemen,
as Mrs. O'Neil bustled about the table. "I
shall never forget a story I read at the time.
I was a little boy in school. It was about a
family who were suffering terribly from the
famine. Their supply of potatoes had come
to an end and the new crop was killed by the
blight. There was no money to pay the rent,
and the poor little children with their parents
were turned out of their home by the hard-hearted
landlord.</p>

<p>"But at this dreadful moment, help came
from a kind friend in America, and they were
saved from further suffering."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had finished speaking, Mrs.
O'Neil told of the suffering people who became
homeless and starving, and who died
before help reached them.</p>

<p>Norah crept close to her mother's side as
she listened to the story. Her big blue eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>This dreadful famine happened before
Mrs. O'Neil was born, for Norah's
grandmother was herself a child at the
time.</p>

<p>The potato crop had been poor for several
years, and many were the families who were
obliged to beg from those who were a little
better off than themselves. But at last there
came a season when all the crops failed. It
was the dreadful year of 1847, when the blight
fell upon every part of Ireland.</p>

<p>Stop for a minute and think of the thousands
of little children who lived almost
entirely on potatoes up to this time. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of them, it is true, had bread every day, and
meat once or twice a week.</p>

<p>But there were many many homes where the
only food of the family was potatoes. Then
you can picture what happened when there
were no more potatoes.</p>

<p>The smiles soon gave place to tears. The
roses faded away from the cheeks. The bright
eyes grew dull and heavy.</p>

<p>Poor little children of Ireland! Think
what became of them when the last piece of
furniture had been sold to buy bread!</p>

<p>Alas! many of them were soon without
even shelter. For they were driven with
their parents out of their small homes, because
there was no possible way of paying the
rent.</p>

<p>Then what? Fever and sickness travelled
from place to place. Death followed in their
pathway. There were many days of cruel
suffering before the rest of the world waked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
up and sent help to the sick and the starving
in Ireland.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="Norah on the grass in front of her house" />
<span class="caption">NORAH&#39;S HOME.</span>
</div>
<p>America showed herself a kind friend in
that sad time. It was some of the very food
she sent to Ireland that saved the life of
Norah's grandmother. She and her brothers
were nearly starving when the help came.
They lived on the seashore and had been trying
to keep themselves alive by eating seaweed
and moss. Those were dreadful times,
indeed.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil stopped to pat Norah's head,
which was in her apron. The child was
crying softly.</p>

<p>"There, there, those hard days are over
now, my child," said her mother, tenderly.
"The sky is brighter for Ireland than it has
been these many years. You must not let
this fine lady see you cry. Enough water
has fallen outside to-day without our adding
to the shower."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>



<p>Norah began to laugh, while she wiped
away the tears with her mother's apron.</p>

<p>The visitors once more rose to go. At the
same time one of the gentlemen stepped to
Mrs. O'Neil's side and said in a low tone,
"We would not think of offering pay for your
kindness to us this afternoon, but it will give
me a great deal of pleasure if you will
take this and buy a little kid with it for
Norah."</p>

<p>He pressed some money into the good
woman's hands.</p>

<p>"But we have one goat now, as you must
have seen," she said.</p>

<p>"Two goats will give the children twice as
much milk as one," he answered, with a laugh.
"And, besides, I want Norah to have the
new goat for her very own."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil could not refuse such a kind
offer. "Thank ye entirely, and may Hiven
send its blessing on ye all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the driver had brought the
horse and the jaunting-car from the little shed,
and the party drove off in the direction of
Killarney.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ST. PATRICK</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sure</span> and it's Father Tom himself," said
Norah's mother. She was in the midst of
the family washing. Katie was rocking baby
Patsy, and Norah was brushing up the rough
mud floor. Every one stopped work at once
and ran out of the cabin, the mother wiping
her hands on her apron, and Norah lifting
Patsy and carrying him along in her strong
young arms.</p>

<p>The whole village had by this time turned
out into the lane and gathered around the kind
fat priest, who had a smile for each and all.</p>

<p>There were old people hobbling along with
the help of sticks, men who had stopped work
for the sake of a blessing from the priest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mothers with babies in their arms, and children
big and little.</p>

<p>It was a glad day when Father Tom came
to the village to see how all were getting along.
There were so few people that the village had
no church of its own. They went four miles
every Sunday to the nearest service. Almost
every one had to walk, for there were only two
or three donkeys and one or two rough carts
in the whole place. A visit from the priest
was a great honour, a very great honour. The
children knelt in his pathway that he might
lay his hands on them and bless them. The
men took off their hats and bowed their heads
low as he passed by. The old women made
as good curtsys as their stiff backs would let
them.</p>

<p>Norah put little Patsy down on the ground,
whispering, "Patsy, dear, touch the good
man's robe with your little hands. It will
make ye a better boy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Tom must have heard the whisper.
He turned around and placed his hands on the
baby's curly head. Then he made a short
prayer and blessed him.</p>

<p>"I will take a sup of tea with you, Mrs.
O'Neil," he said to Norah's mother. "I am
quite tired, for I have walked all the way from
my home this morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil was much pleased. She hurried
home, while the priest and children followed
her more slowly.</p>

<p>As she hung the kettle over the fire and set
the table for the priest's lunch, he gathered the
children around him and told them stories of
St. Patrick, the dearest of all saints to the
Irish people.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time ago that the King of
Ireland was holding a festival in the Hall of Tara.</p>

<p>"Put out all the fires," he had commanded
his people. "Let no light be seen till a blaze
bursts forth from the hill of Tara."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Not one of his subjects would have dared
to disobey the king's command.</p>

<p>You may judge, therefore, how surprised he
was when he looked out into the darkness and
saw a light. It grew stronger and stronger
every moment. A great fire was blazing near
by on the top of a hill!</p>

<p>Who could have dared to disobey the king?
What was the meaning of the fire? The
Druid priest for whom the king sent in haste
said:</p>

<p>"O king, if that fire is not put out to-night,
it will never die in this country."</p>

<p>Now it happened that the festival which the
king and his people were celebrating was held
on the night before Easter Sunday. Few
people of Erin had at that time heard of
Easter Sunday. They knew nothing of the
life of the Christ Child. They were Druids,
and had a strange belief of their own.</p>

<p>Their chief priests dwelt in the dark forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of oak-trees, and taught their followers to
worship fire as the symbol of the sun.</p>

<p>But a new teacher had come into their
country. He had a message to the people.
He wished to tell them of the Christian religion
and of Jesus, who had lived and suffered
and died to help all mankind.</p>

<p>The name of the new teacher was Patrick,
and Scotland was his early home. When he
was sixteen years old, he was surprised by a
band of robbers. They made him their prisoner
and took him with them to Ireland.</p>

<p>After he had been with them six months, he
managed to get free and went back to Scotland.</p>

<p>But he was carried off a second time, and
again he escaped. After he reached his own
home once more, he said to himself, "I should
like to help the people of Ireland. I should
like to tell them of Jesus and his religion."</p>

<p>He began to study and prepare himself for
teaching. At last he was made a bishop.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>After many years, he was able to go back to
Ireland. It was what he had long wished to do.</p>

<p>It was the eve of Easter Sunday when he
lighted that great fire on the hilltop and surprised
the king by his daring.</p>

<p>"I will send for the man who kindled that
fire. Let him come before me at once," commanded
the king.</p>

<p>Patrick was brought in haste, but he was
not frightened in the least.</p>

<p>When the king and the princes, the nobles
and the Druid priests were gathered together,
he told them he had come to Erin to put out
the fires of the Druids. He wished to stop
the making of the pagan sacrifices in which the
people then believed. He had brought something
better in their place. It was the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>What do you suppose the king replied?</p>

<p>He was very angry, of course. But still he
asked Patrick to meet the wise men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
country the next day and talk the matter over.
Then he could explain his belief to them.</p>

<p>On the next day he did meet them. He
talked so well and so wisely that many of the
listeners thought he knew a great deal more
than they did. They became Christians then
and there.</p>

<p>The king then gave Patrick the right to
preach all over Ireland. As he went from
place to place, he spoke so well that all those
who listened to him felt his great power.</p>

<p>In a short time the whole of the people
became Christians, and the strange worship of
the Druids came to an end.</p>

<p>Father Tom told Norah and her sister
many wonderful stories of the life of St.
Patrick. He told of a spring of water he had
visited. This spring worked miracles.</p>

<p>It happened that St. Patrick and St. Bridget
were one day taking a walk. She said she was
thirsty. St. Patrick struck the ground with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
staff. Water instantly began to bubble up
through the earth, and a spring has been there
ever since.</p>

<p>Father Tom went on to tell of strange wriggling
things called snakes. He had seen them
in other countries. They were something like
big worms, and were of different colours. The
bite of some of them was poisonous.</p>

<p>"But we have none of them in our own
beautiful Ireland," he said. "You may thank
the blessed St. Patrick for sending them out of
this country."</p>

<p>Norah and Katie both shivered when they
thought of the snakes. How good St. Patrick
was to drive the horrid creatures out of Ireland!</p>

<p>"There is a grand church in the city of
Dublin called St. Patrick's Cathedral. When
you grow up, Norah, you must surely visit it,"
said the kind priest, as he finished his story-telling.
"It stands on the very spot where St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Patrick himself once built a church. It is a
fine building, and its spire reaches higher up
toward heaven than anything you have ever
seen made by men.</p>

<p>"But, my dear little children, your mother
has prepared me a nice luncheon. I must eat
it, and then visit poor Widow McGee, who is
very ill."</p>

<p>A half-hour afterward, Father Tom had left
the little home, and Mrs. O'Neil was once
more hard at work over her wash-tub. Norah
was out in the yard amusing baby Patsy.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother," she called, "Mrs. Maloney
is on her way here. She has just stopped
at Mrs. Flynn's."</p>

<p>"Come in and get some petaties ready for
her, Norah. I don't want to stop again in
my work." (Mrs. O'Neil pronounced it
"wurruk.")</p>

<p>Mrs. Maloney lived in a lonely cabin about
two miles away. You would hardly believe it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
but Norah's home was almost a palace beside
Mrs. Maloney's.</p>

<p>There was one little window, as she would
have called it. It was really only a hole in the
wall. When heavy rains fell, the old woman
stuffed it with marsh-grass. The thatched
roof had fallen in at one end of the cabin.
The furniture was a chair and a rough bedstead.</p>

<p>Poor old Mrs. Maloney! Once she had a
strong husband and eight happy children,
but, one by one, they had died, and now she
was old and feeble, and had no one in the world
to look after her.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the generous people
whom she visited always had something to
give and a kind word to speak to her?</p>

<p>Every few days, she went from house to
house, holding out her apron as she stood in
the doorway. She did not need to say a word.
One kind woman would give her a bit of tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
another a loaf of bread, a third a cabbage, and
a fourth a little butter.</p>

<p>In this way she was kept from starving, or
from going to the workhouse, which she
dreaded nearly as much.</p>

<p>As Norah dropped the potatoes into her
apron, the old woman blessed her heartily.
As she turned to leave, Mrs. O'Neil called
after her to ask how she got along in yesterday's
bad storm.</p>

<p>"Sure and I was that feared I dared not
stay in the cabin. It was so bad I thought it
would fall down on me shoulders. So I wint
out and sat on the turf behind it. I was wet
indade when the storm was over."</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad," said Mrs. O'Neil, in a
voice of pity. "We must see what can be
done for you."</p>

<p>She did not forget. That very night she
asked her husband if he could not find time to
mend the old woman's hut and make it safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to live in. He promised her that as soon as
the potatoes were hoed he would get his friend
Mickey Flynn to help him and they would fix
it all right.</p>

<p>"Ah! Tim, Tim," said his wife, with her
eyes full of tears, "of all the eight children
Mrs. Maloney has lost, there is none she
grieves over like her boy John, that went to
Ameriky and was never heard of again.</p>

<p>"Maybe he lost his life on the way there.
Maybe he died all alone in that far-away land,
with no kind friends near him. No one but
God knows."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil crossed herself as she went on,
"Think of our own dear girl in Ameriky, and
what might happen to her!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DANIEL O'CONNELL</div>

<div class='poem'>
"O Paddy, dear, and did you hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The news that's going round?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The shamrock is forbid by law</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To grow on Irish ground."</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Norah</span> was sitting by her father's side as
the family were gathered around the fireplace
one chilly evening. She was singing that song
they loved so well, "The Wearing of the
Green."</p>

<p>"I picked some shamrock leaves this morning,
and I put them in the big book to press.
Can they go in the next letter to Maggie,
mother?" asked the little girl, as she finished
singing.</p>

<p>She jumped down from her seat and went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a shelf, from which she took the treasure of the
family. It was the only book they owned
besides their prayer-books.</p>

<p>It told the story of a man loved by every
child of Erin,&mdash;the story of Daniel O'Connell.</p>

<p>Opening the leaves carefully, Norah took
out a spray of tiny leaves. They looked very
much like the white clover which is so common
in the fields of America. It was a cluster of
shamrock leaves, the emblem of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Yes, it shall go to Maggie without fail,"
said Norah's mother. "It will make her
heart glad to see it. The fields behind our
cabin will come to her mind, and the goat she
loved so well, feeding there. Oh, but she has
niver seen Patsy yet!"</p>

<p>"Father, please tell us the story of that
great man," said Norah. "I am never tired
of hearing it."</p>

<p>Norah pointed to the big book as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
spoke. The first money Maggie had sent
from America had bought it, so it was doubly
precious to every one in the little home.</p>

<p>Daniel O'Connell! What a friend he had
been to Ireland! The face of Norah's father
grew brighter as he began to tell the story of
the brave man who had worked so hard to
help his people. But the story-teller first
went back in the history of Ireland to a time
long before the birth of O'Connell.</p>

<p>The Irish had at last been conquered by
England. They had fought against her for
four hundred years. It was hard now to have
English rulers in the country and to have English
lords take their lands away from them.</p>

<p>It was harder still to have these rulers say,
"You must worship as we worship. If you
remain Catholics, we will punish you."</p>

<p>The hard-hearted Cromwell came to Ireland,
bringing a large supply of Bibles, scythes, and
firearms. The Bibles were for those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
willing to become Protestants. The firearms
were used for killing those who would not give
up their religion. The scythes cut down the
crops of those who did not happen to get
killed and yet held to their faith.</p>

<p>"They shall be starved into obeying my
orders," said the stern Cromwell.</p>

<p>As though this were not enough, forty thousand
of the Irish people were driven to the
seacoast. They were put on board ships and
sent to Spain. Never more should they see
the Emerald Isle they loved so well.</p>

<p>Weeping and moaning could be heard all
through Ireland. But a still more pitiful sight
followed. It was a procession of children who
had been taken from their homes. They, too,
were driven on board ships which were waiting
for them. These poor helpless boys and girls
were to become slaves on the tobacco plantations
of the West Indies.</p>

<p>How their mothers' hearts must have ached!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
What sobs and groans must have filled many
a lonely cottage of Ireland!</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years passed by.
They were hard years, and full of trouble.</p>

<p>Then the people began to whisper to each
other, "A real helper has come at last."</p>

<p>It was the young Irishman, Daniel O'Connell,
who lived the life of a country boy in a
quiet place in Kerry. It was scarcely twenty-five
miles from Norah's home.</p>

<p>An old schoolmaster taught Daniel his letters
in a little village school. No one noticed
the brightness of the boy's mind until long
afterward, when he was sent to a college in
France. After he had been there a year, the
principal began to see he was not like most
boys.</p>

<p>"He will be a great man, unless I am much
mistaken," he thought. He was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Daniel studied hard and became a lawyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
His chief thought was always, "Ireland! Poor
Ireland! How can I help my country?"</p>

<p>He worked early and late. He studied far
into the night. He would have little chance
as a lawyer unless he became very wise, and
was keen and quick in his wits.</p>

<p>For he was a Catholic. That was much
against him. The judges in the courts were
Protestants and were ready to favour Protestant
lawyers.</p>

<p>But O'Connell's heart was full of courage.
He did not lose hope for a single moment.</p>

<p>When he began to practise law, he showed
every one what a bright mind he had. He was
quick to see little mistakes and point them out.</p>

<p>He stayed in the court-room during the
whole of a trial. He would not leave it for a
minute, even if he had been there many hours.
He had lunch brought in to him. He was
afraid if he left the court that something might
be said he ought to hear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is very bright." "He sees every
blunder." "He is a sharp-witted fellow."
People began to say things like these. Or,
perhaps, some bold Irishman would tell his
friend, "England can't have it all her own
way much longer. Dan O'Connell will see to
that."</p>

<p>Now, while this clever young lawyer was
busy in the courts in the daytime, he was
doing just as important work in the night.</p>

<p>Evening after evening he met with the
friends of Ireland. He talked with them of
the best way to help their country.</p>

<p>"But no blood must be shed," he would
say again and again. "No blood must be shed.
That would be too high a price to pay. Besides,
it has been fully tried for hundreds of
years, and nothing but bitterness and misery
has come of it. And yet the Catholics must
have equal rights with the Protestants."</p>

<p>He saw only one way of bringing this about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
It was by getting all the people to vote alike.
Then the English rulers would see how strong
and how much in earnest the Irish people
were.</p>

<p>There were years of hard work before Daniel
O'Connell was able to bring about any change.
At last, however, the government of England
was obliged to pass a law giving Catholics the
right to vote and hold office the same as
Protestants.</p>

<p>It is said that when the king signed the law
he was so angry he broke the pen with which
it was done, and stamped upon it. But he
knew he had to do it, and there was no way
out of it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="very tall tower" />
<span class="caption">THE MONUMENT TO DANIEL O&#39;CONNELL.</span>
</div>

<p>Daniel O'Connell had won. He was the
great Liberator of his religion in Great Britain.</p>

<p>He now tried to gain a separate government
for Ireland. But he did not live to finish his
work. He was seized with illness. This very
time was the beginning of the dreadful famine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>O'Connell could not keep his mind from
thinking of the sufferings of his people, and
so, of course, he gained no strength. His
doctors gave up hope.</p>

<p>The great lawyer and Liberator had but one
wish now. He would like to die in Rome
under the blessing of the Pope. He did not
live long enough to reach the religious capital
of the Catholic world, but his heart
was preserved and sent there, by his own
wish.</p>

<p>His body was sent to Ireland, where there
was a grand funeral.</p>

<p>A great monument stands to-day in the city
of Dublin. It was built in honour of Ireland's
brave helper and true lover, Daniel O'Connell.</p>

<p>It is shaped like the round towers still standing
here and there throughout Ireland. They
are so old that no one knows when or why
they were built. They stand tall and straight
and strong and silent. But it seems as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they would say, "Look at us and think of the
grand old days of Erin!"</p>

<p>Some people think they were watch-towers
from which the enemy could be discovered far
away.</p>

<p>When the people wished to build a monument
to Daniel O'Connell, they thought nothing
would be more proper than a copy of the
old watch-towers still standing in the country
and reminding every one of the old glories of
Ireland.</p>

<p>As Norah's father finished the story, the
little girl got up softly and went to a drawer,
from which she drew a picture. It was that
of a white hound, the dog Daniel O'Connell
loved so much.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, putting her arms around
his neck, "if you ever see a white hound at
the fair in Killarney, please buy it for your
little Norah. I will love it tenderly for the
sake of that great man."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KILLARNEY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>, mother! Mollie says can I go
with her for a day at Killarney?" cried
Norah, rushing into the house quite out of
breath.</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was no wonder. She had
run every step from her friend Mollie's, which
was a good half-mile away.</p>

<p>Mollie's father seemed quite rich in Norah's
eyes. He had a farm, where he kept three
cows and twenty sheep. Yes, and a horse
besides. Not a donkey, mind you. Two of
Norah's neighbours owned donkeys, but Mollie's
father was so well off that he had a real
live horse, and a jaunting-car of his very own.</p>

<p>When the work was not heavy, the farmer
sometimes took his family for a day's pleasure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it is fine weather to-morrow," he promised
Mollie, "you shall ask Norah to go with
us. It will be a rale treat for her."</p>

<p>How Norah's eyes sparkled as she told her
mother of the invitation! Her cheeks were
more rosy than ever, and as she laughed over
the good news, her teeth looked for all the
world like the loveliest of pearls.</p>

<p>The next morning she was out-of-doors
at sunrise, to see what signs there were of
good weather. Dame Nature was very kind
to the little girl, and made the sun spread
his loveliest colours over the eastern sky.</p>

<p>There was a great scrubbing and cleaning
before Norah was ready to start. Her mother
combed and brushed her thick, long hair, and
made it into two glossy braids. What did it
matter if there was no hat to wear! She was
so pretty, she did not need straw or ribbon to
make people stop to look at the bright, happy
face, with eyes ever ready to laugh or cry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>When she was dressed in her pink cotton
gown (it was the only one she had, and her
mother had washed and ironed and mended it
the night before, after Norah had gone to
bed), she ate her breakfast, and slipped over
the fields to Mollie's, as happy as a lark.</p>

<p>The horse and car already stood waiting at
the door. Mollie and Norah, and Mollie's
sister Bridget, sat together on one side of the
car, while the jolly farmer, with his wife and
baby, filled the other seat. Mollie's big
brother Tim was the driver.</p>

<p>As they jogged along through the beautiful
country, the party sang "Killarney" and
other favourite songs. After awhile, Mollie's
mother started "The harp that once thro'
Tara's halls," and every one joined in with
a will.</p>

<p>When the song came to an end, the farmer
told the children about an old harper who
used to go wandering through the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
He stopped at every place to play the tunes
the people loved so well.</p>

<p>But that was before Mollie and Norah were
born. Yes, before even the farmer himself
was born. He had heard his mother tell
about the old man, and how bright his eyes
grew as his fingers drew out the tunes from
the harp.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there were many such
harpers in the country. Those were the days
of the Irish kings and lords. There were
feasts and dancing and music in many a stone
castle in those times.</p>

<p>But now, alas, most of the castles
are only ruins, where the kindly ivy
covers the piles of stones, and the wind
howls through the empty door and window
places.</p>

<p>One castle was the grandest of all. It was
called the Hall of Tara, and was built on the
top of a high hill. Mollie and Norah had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
often heard of the doings in that grand
building.</p>

<p>It was the place where the Irish princes met
together to choose their king. It was there
that he was crowned, upon an upright stone
that actually roared during the ceremony. At
least, so the story runs.</p>

<p>The laws of the country were made in the
Hall of Tara, and a great feast was served
there before commencing business each day.
Three loud blasts were sounded by the trumpeter
to call the people together in the great
dining-room.</p>

<p>Not only princes and nobles met in Tara's
Hall. There were also poets and wise men.
For those were the days when Ireland had
places of learning where many scholars gathered,
to study history and poetry, the movements
of the sun and stars, and many other
things. Those were great days for Old Ireland.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, see! See!" cried Norah.</p>

<p>Mollie's brother stopped the horse to let
every one see the beautiful sight before them.
The lovely lakes, shut in by high mountains,
were ahead of them.</p>

<p>"They are the jewels of Erin," cried Mollie's
mother. "They are diamonds sparkling
on the breast of our country."</p>

<p>It was no wonder she spoke as she did. It
would be hard to find any spot in the
world more beautiful than the Lakes of
Killarney.</p>

<p>As the horse started up once more, they
passed high stone walls covered with moss and
ferns and ivy. The branches of tall trees met
together over their heads, with vines wound
lovingly about their trunks. The whole view
was so beautiful that even the children became
quiet. No one felt like talking.</p>

<p>"We will not spend any time in Killarney
town," said Mollie's father. "This is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to be a day outdoors, childer. We'll have a
rale picnic."</p>

<p>Mollie and Norah clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"We must go to Ross Castle, that's sure.
And of course you want to visit Muckross
Abbey and hear the echo below the Eagle's
Nest," the farmer went on.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Castle Lough and Glenna bay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Still at Muckross you must pray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though the monks are now at rest."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So sang the girls in answer.</p>

<p>You must know that Killarney is the most
beautiful part of the beautiful country of Ireland.
One day is not enough to see all that
is worth seeing.</p>

<p>No one could blame the children for not
wanting to spend any of their time in the little
dirty town at the end of the lakes.</p>

<p>The horse was driven close to the shore of
Lough Lean, or the Lake of Learning. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is the name given it by the people of the
country because two universities once stood
near its shores.</p>

<p>The party got out of the jaunting-car and
sat down at the water's edge to eat their lunch.
There were no cakes or pies, but nothing
could have tasted better to the hungry children
than the thick slices of bread and butter,
the home-made cheese, and the rich goat's milk.</p>

<p>And then, every time they lifted their eyes
they could see the green meadows on one side,
and on the other the mountains covered with
purple heather and thick forests.</p>

<p>Out on the clear waters of Lough Lean
were many little islands, looking like so many
emeralds set in the silvery bosom of the lake.</p>

<p>"What lovely homes they would make for
the fairies," whispered Norah to Mollie. She
always spoke of the fairies in a whisper. Perhaps
she felt they might be provoked if she
mentioned them in her usual voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"I believe they choose just such places to
live in," answered Mollie. "I think there
must be hawthorn-trees growing there."</p>

<p>Both Norah and Mollie believed in fairies.
They had as much faith in them as many little
boys and girls in America have in Santa Claus.
They thought hawthorn-trees the favourite
places for the midnight parties of the fairies.
It was in the shade of the hawthorn-trees
that these beautiful sprites feasted on dew, and
danced to the music of fairy harps.</p>

<p>As the children sat whispering together,
Molly's father began to tell the story of
Lough Lean. The little girls were only too
glad to listen.</p>

<p>He told the old legend of the time when
there was no lake at all. A fine city stood
here in its place, and in the city there lived
a brave warrior, whose name was O'Donaghue.</p>

<p>Everything one could wish for was in the
city except plenty of water. There was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
small spring, to be sure. A great magician
had given it to the people. But he had made
one condition, which was this: whoever drew
water from the spring must cover it with a
certain silver vessel.</p>

<p>It happened one day that the brave O'Donaghue
drank more wine than he should. It
made him very bold. He ordered his servants
to go to the spring and bring him the
silver bowl that covered it.</p>

<p>"It will make a good bathtub for me," he
said, and he laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Pray don't make us do this," cried his
frightened servants.</p>

<p>He laughed all the louder, and answered:
"Don't be afraid. The water will be all the
better for the fresh night air."</p>

<p>The silver bowl was brought to the daring
warrior. But as the servants entered the
house, they imagined they heard terrible
sounds about them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>They shook with fear as they thought,
"We are going to be punished for breaking
the magician's command."</p>

<p>One of the servants was so frightened that
he left the city and fled to the mountains.
It was well for him that he did so,
for when the morning came, he looked
down into the valley and saw no city
at all.</p>

<p>Not a sign of a house or living being was
in sight. A sheet of water was stretched out
before his astonished eyes. It was the beautiful
Lough Lean.</p>

<p>As Mollie's father repeated the legend, the
children bent over the lake. Perhaps they
could see the roofs of palaces, or the tops of
towers, still standing on the bottom of the
water. They had heard of people who said
they had seen them. But the children were
disappointed.</p>

<p>Perhaps when they went rowing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
afternoon, they might yet catch a glimpse
of the hidden city. Who could tell?</p>

<p>Mollie's father had more to tell of another
man, whose name was also O'Donaghue. He
pointed to a little island not far from the
shore. It was Ross Island, and an old, old
castle, called Ross Castle, was still standing
there.</p>

<p>The stone walls were now in ruins. They
were overgrown with moss and ivy. But hundreds
and hundreds of years ago it was a
great stronghold of Ireland's bravest warriors.</p>

<p>The chief of them all was the daring
O'Donaghue. Even now he cannot rest easy
in his grave. Every seven years he rises up,
and, mounting a white horse, rides around
Ross Castle. And as he rides every stone
goes back into its old place, and the castle
is once more as strong and grand as in its best
days.</p>

<p>But this is only for the one night. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the sun shines the next morning, a heap of
ruins is standing there, where the owls and
bats may keep house in comfort.</p>

<p>"How I should like to see the knight on
his white horse!" said Norah.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I should be afraid, I'm sure,"
said Mollie. "After all, the day is the best
time to be outdoors, and my bed at home
is the safest place after dark."</p>

<p>When the lunch was eaten, the whole party
crossed a bridge that spanned the water to
Ross Island. The children played games
over the smooth lawns, picked flowers, and
told fairy stories.</p>

<p>Then Mollie's brother rowed the girls out
on the lake. Many a time he rested on his
oars while the children called out and then
listened for the echo to answer them.</p>

<p>"There it is, hark!" said Tim.</p>

<p>A party of travellers came rowing toward
them. They had hired an Irish piper to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with them. As he played a slow tune, the
answer came back.</p>

<p>Tim whistled, and the echo repeated it.
Then Norah sang the first line of "Come
Back to Erin," and the echo sang it back
again.</p>

<p>But the afternoon was going fast, and the
children could now hear Mollie's father calling
to them from the shore. They must get back
to land as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When they reached the car, they jumped in,
and all started at once for Muckross Abbey,
at the other end of the lake.</p>

<p>It had once been a great place of learning,
but it was now in ruins. Ah! but such beautiful
ruins, covered with mosses and creeping
vines. How the ivy seemed to love the old
stone walls!</p>

<p>Some of Ireland's greatest men were buried
here. Poets and soldiers and wise men lie
in their tombs. Norah and Mollie stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
softly and spoke in low tones as they walked
among them, half-buried in moss and ivy.</p>

<p>But they did not linger long. They loved
the sunshine and the brightness outside, and
were glad to get back to them.</p>

<p>They took their places in the jaunting-car
once more, and started on their homeward
way.</p>

<p>As they drove along, they passed the grand
home of a rich Englishman. A long and fine
driveway led up to it from the road. It was
almost hidden in a lovely grove.</p>

<p>Just as they drew near, a party of horsemen
passed them and turned into the driveway,
blowing their horns. They had been out
hunting and were now returning.</p>

<p>"Arrah! they have a jolly life," said Mollie's
mother. "Hunting and fishing and feasting.
That is the way they pass their days.
But, glory be to God, I have my husband and
childer and our little farm, and I am content."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She might have said, also:</p>

<p>"I live in the most beautiful part of beautiful
Ireland. I can look to my heart's content
at the lovely hills and lakes, the fields filled
with flowers, and the cascades rippling down
the mountainsides."</p>

<p>Yes, let glory be to God that the poor
can enjoy these blessings, and it costs them
nothing.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HALLOWE'EN</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It's</span> jumping wid joy I am," said Norah.</p>

<p>It was the eve of the first day of November,
and the little girl was putting on a new dress.
Her father had been to the pig fair at Killarney.
He had sold his pigs for a good price,
and had brought home enough blue cloth to
make gowns for both Norah and Katie.</p>

<p>But what is a pig fair? perhaps you are
wondering. It is like any other fair in the
old countries, except that little else is sold
besides pigs.</p>

<p>Pigs! pigs! pigs! Big pigs and little pigs.
Pigs rolling in fat and weighing a good three
hundred pounds. Little baby pigs, pink and
white, and too young to leave their mothers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Streets full of men and pigs. Everybody
talking, and many of them laughing and telling
each other funny stories.</p>

<p>And all along the sides of the roads were
horses and donkeys fastened to queer-looking
wagons, in which the pigs had been brought to
market.</p>

<p>Oh, a pig fair is a jolly sight, as Norah's
brother would tell you.</p>

<p>The two blue dresses were made in a hurry
by the mother, and now the whole family were
going to a party at Mollie's house. It was to
celebrate Hallowe'en. Patsy had to go, too,
for there was no one to leave him with at
home.</p>

<p>There was no baby-carriage for him. But
that did not matter. He could go on his
mother's broad back, after she had wrapped
a big shawl over her shoulders.</p>

<p>The father led the procession. He felt very
grand in a coat with long tails and a tall hat.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, Norah and Katie felt fine in
their new gowns. They walked behind their
mother, looking from time to time at her new
red petticoat, and then at their own dresses.</p>

<p>It seemed a longer walk than usual, because
they were so anxious to get there and join
in the sport.</p>

<p>"Hear the piper, hear the piper!" shouted
Katie, as they at last drew near the farmhouse.
And her little bare feet began to dance along
the path.</p>

<p>A minute more, and the house door opened
wide, and the visitors were made welcome.</p>

<p>The kitchen was not large, and it was
already well filled. The big bed had been
moved over into a corner to make room for
dancing. The older people, who did not
dance, sat on the edge of the bed, while the
children nestled together on the floor against
the wall.</p>

<p>The turf fire was glowing in the big fireplace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and giving a pleasant welcome to all.
On the rafters overhead, some hens were fast
asleep, not seeming to mind the music and
laughter in the least.</p>

<p>The piper was playing his jolliest tunes, and
two young people were dancing a jig when
Norah arrived.</p>

<p>"Good! good!" cried the rest of the company,
as the young girl went around and
around the young man, her partner, never
once losing the step. Her heavy shoes made
a great clatter as they came down on the
paved floor.</p>

<p>Her face grew redder and redder. Her
breath came harder and harder, but she would
not give up dancing till the piper himself left
off playing.</p>

<p>"Let us bob for apples now," said the host.
"We will give these young folks a chance
to get their breath."</p>

<p>A big tub of water was brought in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
some apples were set floating in it. Who
would duck for the apples? Every one who
had a chance. It did not matter how old or
how young they might be.</p>

<p>It was such fun! One head after another
went down into the water to see who could
seize an apple between his teeth without using
his hands to help him.</p>

<p>When the company grew tired of this sport,
there were other games and more lively
dances.</p>

<p>Then there were refreshments. There was
plenty of tea for the big folks, and bread and
cheese and potato cakes for all.</p>

<p>As they sat eating, the piper began to play
a soft, sad tune.</p>

<p>"They do say he learned it of the fairies,"
whispered Mollie to Norah.</p>

<p>Just then, the children's school-teacher
came and sat down beside them. He heard
the word "Fairies."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe in fairies?" he asked
Norah.</p>

<p>She lifted her blue eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>"Sure, sir. They live in the hills and
caves. And there be some, I have heard,
who have their homes under the waves of
the sea. This night they are more lively
than at most times.</p>

<p>"Mother was careful this morning not to
drain the milk-pail. She wanted to leave a
drop in case the fairy folk should come along
and wish for a sup. And sure, sir,
father never puts the fire out at night.
He says maybe the fairies might like
to rest a bit on our hearth before the morning."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster smiled, but did not contradict
the little girl. He thought it would
only trouble the child.</p>

<p>Norah's father had once said, "The teacher
is a man of great larnin'. And, strange to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
say, I have heard that people of larnin' have
little belief in fairy folk."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to tell you a
story?" asked the teacher, after a moment or
two.</p>

<p>"Oh, plaze do, indade!" said Norah and
Mollie together. They loved their teacher
dearly.</p>

<p>Their school was kept in a plain, bare little
room with rough benches and desks. There
was nothing bright or pretty about it. But
their teacher was kind, and tried to help them
learn. They were always glad to be with him
and hear him talk.</p>

<p>"You have never been to the north of
Ireland, have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. We've never been farther
from home than the Lakes of Killarney,"
answered Mollie.</p>

<p>"But you know, of course, that this is an
island, and if you travel to the northeastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
shore of Ireland you must cross the sea if
you want to go to Scotland."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, you showed that to us on
the map at school."</p>

<p>"I will tell you of a giant named Finn
McCool, who is said to have lived on that
rocky shore. Do you know what a giant
is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. He's like any other man, only
he's ever and ever so much bigger," answered
Norah.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. This particular giant
wished to fight another giant who lived in
Scotland. He invited him to come across
the sea to Ireland. But the Scotch giant was
not able to swim. So he answered:</p>

<p>"'I would gladly come if I could, but
I cannot get across.'</p>

<p>"'It's an aisy matter to make a road for
you,' said Finn. 'It is hardly worth speaking
about.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"He set to work at once and built a road,
or causeway, made of stone pillars. They
were placed close together, and reached upward
from the bed of the sea. Of course, the
Scotch giant could not refuse to come now."</p>

<p>"Could we see it if we went there?" Mollie
eagerly asked.</p>

<p>"You could see a part of it. But, according
to the legend, it was broken in two by the
sea. Even now, you could walk out upon it
for quite a distance. But the causeway slopes
downward into the water, and then seems to
stop. Some people, however, believe it extends
under the sea clear to Scotland.</p>

<p>"It is certainly a wonderful thing, and
many people from other countries go to see it.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it was really the work of
giants, children?"</p>

<p>"Indade, whatever else could it be, sir?
No common man could do it."</p>

<p>"No one knows; no one knows," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
schoolmaster, thoughtfully. "But come, let
us join in the songs. We know more about
them."</p>

<p>How sweet and clear the voices sounded,
as the favourite tunes of Ireland rang through
the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Then came fairy stories and jokes, and the
party broke up just as the little wooden clock
on the mantel struck the hour of midnight.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FAIRIES</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Wake</span> up, me darlint. You have been
dozing by the fire long enough," said Norah's
father.</p>

<p>It was a cold evening in winter. Patsy was
sound asleep in his bed. The good mother
sat knitting socks for her husband; Mike was
whittling a hockey stick to play with the next
day. Little Katie was singing her rag doll to
sleep, while Norah lay on the floor by the
fireplace with eyes shut tight and breathing
softly.</p>

<p>When her father touched her cheek and
spoke to her, she sprang up with a sudden
start.</p>

<p>"I've been dreaming. Oh, it was such a
beautiful dream!" she exclaimed. "I was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the fairies in a big cave. They were having
a party, and they looked just lovely. Indade,
it was the sweetest dream I ever had."</p>

<p>"Do tell us about it," cried Katie. "Oh,
do, Norah. And don't forget a single thing."</p>

<p>Norah's cheeks were rosy red, and her blue
eyes sparkled as she painted the dream picture
to the listening family.</p>

<p>She had been in the grand hall of a cave.
It was like no other hall she had ever seen.
The walls were shining with precious stones.
Shining pendants hung from the ceiling and
glistened in the light given by hundreds of
fairy torches.</p>

<p>But the fairies themselves were the loveliest
sight of all. Oh, they were such tiny creatures!
The young lady fairies were all in
white, and their soft, fair hair hung far down
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen fairies wore green
jackets and white breeches.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The fairy queen had a golden crown on her
head, and when she waved her golden wand,
every one hastened to do her bidding.</p>

<p>They all had sweet, kind faces, and looked
lovingly at Norah as they danced around her
to the fairy music.</p>

<p>When Norah had got this far in her story,
she turned to her father, and said:</p>

<p>"Then you called me, and the fairies all
looked sad, and then&mdash;then&mdash;that's all I can
remember."</p>

<p>"The fairies are wonderful people, and we
must keep them for our friends, but I don't
want them to call my Norah away from me.
You must never turn your ears to the fairy
music, my child."</p>

<p>Norah's father looked serious as he said
these words. He had heard of a young girl
who had listened to fairy music. It made her
lose all love for her dearest friends. She forgot
everything that had happened in her life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
After that, she could only think of the fairies,
and long to be with them. She died a short
time afterward.</p>

<p>But, of course, Norah had only been <i>dreaming</i>
of the fairies. That was quite different.</p>

<p>"Tell us some fairy stories, father dear. It
is just the night for them," begged Katie.</p>

<p>Her father liked nothing better. He began
at once to tell of a battle between two bands
of fairies. It was in the night-time, and not
far from the very place where they were living.</p>

<p>Norah's father had seen with his own eyes
the man who told the story of the strange
battle.</p>

<p>The fairies were no more than nine inches
tall, but there were millions of them. They
marched along in rows just like any other
soldiers. The men of one army were in green
coats, and the men of the other in red ones.</p>

<p>When they had drawn up and faced each
other, the signal was given to begin the battle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>What a fight it was! The man who saw it
became so excited he began to shout. Then,
lo and behold! every fairy vanished from
sight, and he found himself lying all alone
on the roadside.</p>

<p>Had he been asleep? was it all a dream,
like that of Norah's? He declared that was
impossible.</p>

<p>The mother and children listened eagerly to
the story. They believed every word of it.</p>

<p>The father did not stop here. He told
now of a grand ball given by the fairies. A
woman in Sligo saw it her very own self.</p>

<p>It was out in a big field, and the moon was
shining on the beautiful scene. Hundreds of
fireflies flew about the fairies, who were dancing
like angels.</p>

<p>But the music! There was never anything
like it in the world. A big frog played the big
fiddle, and two kittens performed on the little
ones. Then there were two big drums beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
by cats, while fat little pigs blew the trumpets.
It must have been a wonderful sight.</p>

<p>"The fairies are very fond of childer," said
Mrs. O'Neil. "They are that fond of them,
they sometimes carry away a sleeping baby
to their own home and leave a fairy child
in its place. And that's the very truth. But
come, husband, tell one more story before
we go to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, do, father!" cried Mike, and
Norah and Katie repeated, "Do, do," after
their brother.</p>

<p>How could any father refuse when children
begged like that?</p>

<p>Norah took possession of one of his knees,
Katie of the other, while Mike stretched himself
out on the floor at his father's feet. As
soon as all was quiet, they listened to the
story of "Ethna, the Bride."</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a great lord,
who had a beautiful young wife. Her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was Ethna. Her husband was so proud of
her, he held feasts every day. All the noblest
people in the land came to his castle and
danced and sang and took part in these feasts.</p>

<p>It happened one evening that, in the very
midst of a dance, as the fair Ethna was
whirling about through the hall in her rich
garments of gauze, studded with sparkling
jewels, she sank lifeless to the floor.</p>

<p>"She has fainted, she has fainted," cried the
company.</p>

<p>She was carried to a couch, where she lay
for hours without knowing anything happening
about her.</p>

<p>But as the morning light began to creep in
through the window, she awoke and told her
husband she had been in the palace of the
fairies. It was very, very beautiful. She
longed to go back now and listen to the fairy
music. It filled her with such joy as she had
never felt before.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>All that day her friends watched her closely,
so she might not leave them again. It was of
no use. As soon as the twilight settled down
over the castle, there was the sound of soft
music outside the walls. Instantly the beautiful
Ethna closed her eyes and sank to sleep.</p>

<p>Every means was tried to wake her, but
in vain. Her nurse was set to watch her,
but for some reason she could not keep
awake, and before the night was over, she,
too, fell asleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke, she discovered that her
charge was missing. Ah! where had she
gone?</p>

<p>Every place about the castle was searched,
but it was of no use. People were sent now
in one direction, now in another, but every
one brought back the same word,&mdash;there was
no sign nor trace of the fair bride. Then the
young lord said:</p>

<p>"I know where she must be. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gone to the fairies. I will go to their king,
Finvarra. He has always been a good friend
to me. He will help me to get her back."</p>

<p>Little did he dream that the king of the
fairies, even Finvarra himself, had fallen in
love with Ethna, and had spirited her away
from her home.</p>

<p>The young lord mounted his horse, and
away he rode at full speed till he came to
the hill of the fairies. There he stopped.</p>

<p>All at once he heard voices. This is what
he heard:</p>

<p>"Finvarra is happy now. He has won the
fair young Ethna. She will never leave his
palace again."</p>

<p>"Ah!" was the reply, "it may happen
yet. For if her husband digs down through
this hill, he can win Ethna again."</p>

<p>"We shall see! We shall see!" exclaimed
the lord when he heard these words.</p>

<p>He sent off at once for workmen to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to the fairy hill. They were to bring pickaxes
and spades.</p>

<p>"Dig without stopping," was his command.
"Dig till you come to the fairy palace."</p>

<p>A great company of men was soon at work.
The air rang with the noise of their spades
striking against the rocks and earth.</p>

<p>When night came they had made a tunnel
into the very heart of the hill. They went
home to rest, and with the first light of morning
they came back to go on with their work.</p>

<p>But, behold! The hill looked as though
no man had touched it. The dirt had all
been replaced at the order of the powerful
fairy king, Finvarra.</p>

<p>The young lord did not give up hope,
however. The men were set to work again,
and again the same thing happened as before.
The work of the day was undone the next
night. A third time the lord tried, and a
third time he failed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>He was overcome by sorrow and disappointment,
when he heard a soft voice speaking
somewhere near him. It said:</p>

<p>"If you sprinkle salt over the earth the
men dig up, Finvarra will have no power
over it."</p>

<p>Once more the young lord was filled with
hope. He sent out into the land in every
direction to get quantities of salt from the
people. And when the workmen stopped
digging at nightfall, the salt was plentifully
sprinkled over the earth.</p>

<p>How anxious the young lord was now!
Had he really found a way of defeating the
fairies? The next morning he eagerly hurried
to the hill to see.</p>

<p>What the voice said was really true. The
tunnel was just as it had been left the night
before. Another day's work was enough to
see it dug clear to the middle of the hill,
and far down into the earth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the men, putting their ears to
the ground, could hear fairy music. Voices,
too, could be heard around them. This is
what they heard:</p>

<p>"Finvarra is sad at heart. It is no wonder.
His palace will crumble to dust, if one of these
mortals touches it with his spade."</p>

<p>"Why does he not save us then, and give
up the young bride?" said another voice.</p>

<p>Then King Finvarra himself spoke, in a
true kingly way. He commanded the workmen
to stop digging, promising that at sunset
he would give Ethna up to her husband.</p>

<p>The young lord was glad of heart, and told
the men to lay down their spades. He could
hardly wait for evening to come. But it did
come at last, and found the impatient husband
sitting on his handsome horse and waiting by
the hillside for his bride.</p>

<p>As the sun lighted the western sky with his
most glorious colours, Ethna, dressed in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
silver robe, appeared in the pathway before
her husband.</p>

<p>He swept her from the ground in his strong
arms, and away they galloped back to the
castle.</p>

<p>But it was not the same Ethna as before
the fairy spell had been cast upon her. Oh,
no! She seemed like one half-asleep. Day
after day she lay on her bed with her eyes
closed. She did not move or speak.</p>

<p>"She has eaten of the fairy food," said the
people. "It will be impossible to break
the spell that has been cast upon her." And
every one was filled with grief.</p>

<p>Three months passed by with no change
in Ethna. One night, as the young lord was
riding through the country, he heard a voice
speaking near him. It said:</p>

<p>"The young husband won back his beautiful
bride. But what good has it done him?
Her spirit is still with the fairies, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
far as he is concerned, she is like one
dead."</p>

<p>As soon as this voice became silent, another
could be heard, saying:</p>

<p>"There is one way to break the fairy spell.
Her husband must take off her girdle and
burn it. Then he must scatter the ashes
before the door. He must not forget to take
the enchanted pin by which the girdle is now
fastened and bury it in a deep hole in the
earth. This is the only way of regaining
the spirit of his wife."</p>

<p>At these words the young lord was filled
with new hope.</p>

<p>He hurried home as fast as his swiftest
horse could carry him, and went at once to
the room of his sleeping wife.</p>

<p>He hastened to her side, and began to do
exactly as the voice had directed.</p>

<p>He drew out the enchanted pin. He removed
the girdle. He burned it in the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Then, carefully gathering the ashes, he scattered
them before the door. The enchanted
pin was buried in a deep hole.</p>

<p>He went anxiously back to Ethna's room.</p>

<p>She was already coming back to life. As
her husband stood at her side, she began to
smile at him in her old, sweet way.</p>

<p>And now she moved and spoke, and took
up her life as in the days before the fairy spell
was cast upon her.</p>

<p>Her husband and all others in the castle
were filled with happiness. There was great
rejoicing. The beautiful Ethna was safe, and
King Finvarra never again tried to win her to
the fairy realm.</p>

<p>Is it a true story? some one asks. If you
do not believe it, you need only go to the hill
through which the tunnel was dug. It can be
seen, even now. And people still call it the
Fairies' Glen.</p>

<p>When Norah's father finished the story, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
children begged him to tell "just one more,
plaze." But he pointed to the clock.</p>

<p>"Late, late it is for you childer to be up,"
he said. "It is to bed ye must go this very
minute."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterward, every one
in the little cabin was settled for the night.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BLARNEY CASTLE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Norah's</span> friend, Mollie, had just got home
from a long journey. At least it seemed a
long one to Norah, who had never been
farther away from home than the Lakes of
Killarney.</p>

<p>Mollie had been all the way to Cork and
Queenstown with her father and mother.
They went to see Mollie's uncle start for
America on a big steamer.</p>

<p>Queenstown is at the mouth of the River
Lee. It used to be called the Cove of Cork,
but the name was changed to Queenstown in
honour of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>It seemed a very big place to Mollie. As
she described the queer cars running through
the city, and the great steamers at the docks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it was a wonderful picture that little Norah
saw in her mind.</p>

<p>Mollie had gone there in a railway train.
When the guard shut her and her parents
inside the car and locked the door, she was
a little frightened at first. Then the engine
gave a fearful shriek, and the train moved.</p>

<p>There were many other people in the car,
or rather "compartment of the railway carriage,"
as they call it in the British Isles.
Their cars are divided into three or four
parts, with doors opening on the sides. Each
part is called a compartment.</p>

<p>It was quite a jolly crowd. Every one
seemed in good humour, and strangers were
soon talking together as if they had always
known each other. They told funny stories,
they joked and laughed, and Mollie soon
forgot her fear of the fast moving train. "It
was just like a party," she told Norah.</p>

<p>At every station, the guard unlocked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
door and let out those who were going no
farther. Others then got in, so the company
was changing all the time.</p>

<p>The compartment in which Mollie rode
was a third-class one, and the floor and seats
were quite bare. But these things did not
trouble the little girl. Her parents could not
afford to buy tickets to go first or second-class.
They were glad enough to be able
to go at all.</p>

<p>Cork was reached at last, and Mollie could
hardly sleep nights after going about the city
in the daytime and seeing the strange sights.</p>

<p>When her uncle had gone away on the big
steamer, she went with her father and mother
into some of the mills and factories. She
saw glass spun into beautiful shapes, woollen
cloths woven by huge machines, and many
other things made as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Sure, it seems as if these big wheels
must be turned by the fairies," she said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Norah, as she told her little friend of what
she had seen.</p>

<p>It was all very interesting, but Norah
liked best of all to hear of Mollie's visit
to Blarney Castle. She asked her to repeat
it over and over again.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="329" height="500" alt="The castle" />
<span class="caption">MOLLIE AND HER FATHER VISIT BLARNEY CASTLE.</span>
</div>
<p>Not far away from Cork is the busy little
town of Blarney. And a little way out
from Blarney is an old, old castle which
is visited by people from all over the
world.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of the Blarney Stone?
Or did you ever hear one person say to
another, who has made a very polite or flattering
speech, "Well, well, I think you must
have kissed the Blarney Stone?"</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not understand the reason
for such a remark. Now you shall
hear it.</p>

<p>If you ever climb to the top of the walls
of Blarney Castle and look down over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
walls on the outside, you will see a certain
stone.</p>



<p>It is a magic stone, you may be told.
It has a great charm, for, if you kiss it,
you will be blessed ever after with the power
of eloquent speech. Your words to charm
and wheedle will never fail you. You will
always be able to say the right thing in the
right place at the right time. You will say it
so well you will make yourself very pleasing
to your listeners.</p>

<p>But how is anybody able to kiss the
Blarney Stone? It is too far down to be
reached from the top, and too far up to
be reached from the bottom. There is only
one way. You must have a rope tied to
your waist, and trust some one to let you
down over the wall till you reach it.</p>

<p>There are some people foolish enough
to do this very thing.</p>

<p>As Mollie stood looking and wishing she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
dared try it, she heard some one telling a
story. It was about a young man who got
his friends to lower him out over the wall.</p>

<p>But, just as his lips touched the stone, a
shower of coins fell to the ground below.
The young man had forgotten to take the
money out of his pockets.</p>

<p>Every one laughed at the story, and
Mollie wished she could have been there to
see the funny sight.</p>

<p>"I didn't kiss the real Blarney Stone,"
she told Norah. "But there was one inside
the walls. It was a sort of make-believe
Blarney Stone, and we all kissed that instead."</p>

<p>"Daniel O'Connell must have been to
Blarney Castle and kissed the stone," said
Norah, quite seriously. "How else could
he have had the power to move every one
by his words? He was a great man. When
I grow up, I'll be after going to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
city of Dublin to see his monimint. You
see if I don't, Mollie darlint."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll be going together, Norah,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>And the two little girls skipped arm in
arm across the fields of the beautiful Emerald
Isle.</p>
